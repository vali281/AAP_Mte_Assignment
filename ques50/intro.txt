q. Explain the concept of equilibrium index and its applications in array problems.
a. Key Points:
   - **Equilibrium Index**:
     - An equilibrium index of an array is an index where the sum of elements to the left of it is equal to the sum of elements to the right of it.
     - More formally, for an index `i`, if `sum(arr[0..i-1]) == sum(arr[i+1..n-1])`, then `i` is an equilibrium index.
     - It is important to note that equilibrium can also exist at the very first or last index of the array under certain conditions (i.e., if the left or right sums are zero).

   - **Applications in Array Problems**:
     1. **Finding the Equilibrium Index**: A common use case is to find such an index where the left and right sums are equal, often used in problems related to balance, partitioning, or equal distribution.
     2. **Partitioning Arrays**: In problems where an array needs to be split into two parts with equal sums or properties, equilibrium index can help in identifying the point of split.
     3. **Load Balancing**: The equilibrium index is often used in load balancing problems, where we need to balance the load between two parts of a system (e.g., servers, containers, etc.).
     4. **Dynamic Arrays**: The equilibrium index is useful in problems where the array size or elements are dynamic, such as in real-time analytics or handling streaming data.
     5. **Optimization Problems**: In optimization problems, finding an equilibrium point can help optimize the algorithm by reducing redundant calculations or by splitting the problem into two sub-problems of equal weight.
     6. **Subarray and Prefix Sum Problems**: The equilibrium index can be used in combination with prefix sums to efficiently solve related problems like finding subarrays with specific sum conditions.

   - **Example**: Given the array `[1, 3, 5, 2, 2]`, index `2` is an equilibrium index since the sum of elements to the left of index `2` (`1 + 3 = 4`) is equal to the sum of elements to the right of index `2` (`2 + 2 = 4`).
