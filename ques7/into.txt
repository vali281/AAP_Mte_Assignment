q.Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems.  
a.It’s an optimization technique used to reduce the time complexity of problems that involve linear data structures (like arrays or strings).
    The idea is simple:
        Instead of checking all possible subarrays or substrings (which takes O(n²) time), 
        you maintain a "window" (a subset of elements) and slide it over the data to compute results on the fly.
