q.Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string. Write its algorithm, program. 
Find its time and space complexities. Explain with suitable example.
a. the time and space complexity is O(n^3) and O(1) respectively for the brute force approach
    anf for the better approach the  time and space complexity is O(n^2) and O(1) respectively
