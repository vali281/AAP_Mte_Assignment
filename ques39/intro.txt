q. Explain the difference between subsets and permutations with examples.
a. Key Points:
   - **Subsets**:
     - A subset is any combination of elements from a set, including the empty set and the set itself.
     - Order does not matter.
     - Example: For the set `{1, 2, 3}`, the subsets are `{}`, `{1}`, `{2}`, `{3}`, `{1, 2}`, `{1, 3}`, `{2, 3}`, `{1, 2, 3}`.
   
   - **Permutations**:
     - A permutation is a specific arrangement or ordering of elements.
     - The order of elements matters.
     - Example: For the set `{1, 2, 3}`, the permutations are `{1, 2, 3}`, `{1, 3, 2}`, `{2, 1, 3}`, `{2, 3, 1}`, `{3, 1, 2}`, `{3, 2, 1}`.
