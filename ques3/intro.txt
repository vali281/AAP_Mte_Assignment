q. Solve the problem of finding the equilibrium index in an array. Write its algorithm, 
program. Find its time and space complexities. Explain with suitable example. 
a. for brute force : the time complexity is O(n^2) and space complexity is O(1)
    for prefix sum approach the time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n)
