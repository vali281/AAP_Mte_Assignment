# Key Points:
- Bit manipulation involves direct operations on binary digits (bits) of numbers
- Common operations: AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>)
- Advantages:
  1. Space Efficiency: Pack multiple flags/values in single integer
  2. Speed: Hardware-level operations are extremely fast
  3. Atomic Operations: Many operations execute in constant time
  4. Algorithm Optimization: Enables elegant solutions for many problems
- Applications:
  - Compression algorithms
  - Cryptography
  - Network protocols
  - Graphics programming
  - Competitive programming optimizations
